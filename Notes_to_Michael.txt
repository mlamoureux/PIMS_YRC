I've had several problems getting these lecture notes to work on my Mac.

1. Can't get animations to work (the HTML command). I seem to be missing a MovieWriter. Probably I have to install ffmpeg but I don't know how yet.
-- I tried installing ffmpeg into /user/local/bin/ but that did not help.
-- By doing the installation in #2 below, it magically fixed this proble. I don't know why. 

2. Can't get the slideshow to work. Probably have to install RISE. I suspect all I need to do is this:
   conda install -c damianavila82 rise
Maybe I do this in a terminal window.
--Actually, this did not work as there is an incompatibiltiy with conda and Python version 3.6.
--Instead, I had to do these three commands in the terminal:
   pip install RISE
   jupyter-nbextension install rise --py --sys-prefix
   jupyter nbextension enable rise --py --sys-prefix

3. R does not run on my Mac. To fix this, I used anaconda to install the packages.
   conda install -c r r-essentials
This seems to install over 100 files on my machine, mostly labelled r-something.

4.  Had to do the to get the data analysis stuff to load.
    pip install pandas-datareader
   That still did not work, seems like Yahoo is messed up.
   Read this: https://github.com/ranaroussi/fix-yahoo-finance
   Tried to instal a fix:
pip install fix_yahoo_finance --upgrade --no-cache-dir

Tried code like this:
from pandas_datareader import data as pdr
import fix_yahoo_finance  # <== that's all it takes :-)

# download dataframe
data = pdr.get_data_yahoo("SPY", start="2017-01-01", end="2017-04-30")

Still fails
